\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This article continues the investigation of the expected utility model of rational choice. We begin by examining how preference relates to utility, before continuing to the representation theorems which formalise the connection. Will we see that the nature of these theorems, coupled with the indeterminacy of statistical inference is a brittle foundation for predictive economic models of consumer choice.

\section{From Utility to Indifference}
Too much of a good thing often tends to the bad. So we dabble, sample and share. In pursuit of variety we swap our goods, shunning stale options in favour of the novel exchange.  For a given good we can differ in our appetites but it's relatively straightforward to find the point where one more donut is one too many.

The possibility of coordinated compromise lies at the core of maximising subjective utility. We seek competitive advantage for our own produce to balance the cost owed to the skills of others. At the limit some trades do not admit any mixture of goods. Not all babies can be cut in half. On the other side of the spectrum, there are some things which we'd give everything. In most cases though a consumer will try to optimise their bundle of goods over an entire marketplace, preserving enough on one key good; money, to remain liquid. 

$$ u(\overrightarrow{g}) = f(g_{0}, g_{1} ... g_{n}) $$

There are number of ways we can specify a utility function, but a typical example is the Cobb-Douglas function. 

$$ u(\overrightarrow{g}) = g_{0}^{\alpha_{0}}g_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} ... g_{n}^{\alpha_{n}}$$

\end{marginfigure} 

Then taking the case of two goods $g1, g2$ we can determine an indifference curve where you would be willing to exchange quantities of $g1$ for an agreeable amount of $g2$.  Set 
$$ k =  g_{1}^{.5}g_{2}^{.5} = (g_{1}g_{2})^{.5}  = \sqrt{g_{1}g_{2}}$$
$$ \Rightarrow k^{2} = g_{1}g_{2} \Rightarrow \frac{k^{2}}{g_{1}} = g_{2}$$
